# ⚙️ C++ — Power, Performance, Precision

> *“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.”* — Linus Torvalds

C++ is a high-performance programming language that gives you **full control over hardware**, **blazing speed**, and **modern abstractions** — all in one place. From game engines 🎮 to operating systems 🖥️, from embedded devices ⚡ to high-frequency trading 💹, C++ is everywhere.

## ✨ Why C++?

* 🚀 **Super Fast** — Compiled to native machine code
* 🧠 **Memory Control** — Manual + smart pointer management
* 🧩 **Multi-Paradigm** — Procedural, OOP, Generic, Functional
* 🛠 **Powerful STL** — Containers, Algorithms, Iterators
* 🌍 **Industry Standard** — Used in AAA games, browsers, databases, kernels

| Feature        | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| OOP            | Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism |
| Templates      | Generic & reusable code                     |
| STL            | `vector`, `map`, `set`, `algorithm`, etc.   |
| RAII           | Safe resource management                    |
| Smart Pointers | `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr`      |
| Modern C++     | C++11 → C++20 → C++23                       |

## ▶️ Your First Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, C++ World ⚡" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🧠 Example — Modern C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (auto n : nums)
        cout << n * n << " ";

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```
1 4 9 16 25
```

## 🔥 Best Practices

* Prefer **`std::vector`** over raw arrays
* Use **RAII** for resource safety
* Avoid raw `new/delete` → use smart pointers
* Write clean, readable, and modern C++
